## 2024-05-24 ([d409732](https://github.com/johnjago/pitch/commit/d4097327654dca9cde6f62aaf563ef7a9e5b49e2))

It’s been a while, but I realized people are using this app a lot! So much for it being a sample project!

I made a number of small improvements, including adding styling and graphics to make it feel more polished, meta tags to make it more discoverable, and links for getting in touch with me in case anyone wants to send feedback.

It’s also mobile-friendly now.

### Behind the scenes

Next.js has been upgraded from 10 to 14.

## 2021-06-03 ([0345f24](https://github.com/johnjago/pitch/commit/0345f2403f9e5d51f4f0ce82837223c1488f3e7e))

- Generate multiple sets of sheets at once.
- Default percents to empty so that it’s easier to delete values.

The pitch card generator is ready for use!

It takes up to 10 pitch names, abbreviations, and percents as input, and when the “Make sheets” button is clicked, it generates Excel files that contain sheets for both the player and the coach.

Both sheets are designed to be printed.
